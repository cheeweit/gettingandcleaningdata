## Getting And Cleaning Data Project Files

This repository contains the R script 'run_analysis.R' that reads the sensors data sets extracted from the Samsung phones, combine the test and training data sets, and clean the data set before calculating the average of each variables for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data and its sources, the transformation and the work that the run_analysis.R script will perform.

data_with_average.txt is the output file containing the final result.
